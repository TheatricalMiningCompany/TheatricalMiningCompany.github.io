S. E. Schulze: Notes on Abraham and Isaac

 

Whatever the confluence of ideas, the impulse to write a play resides most in a delight with the private workings of imagination, from a proclivity to fully immerse in make believe while shaping the results to a direct relationship with what is real. It comes from hearing characters speak and from feeling what they feel and by giving imaginative structure to their words and acts in such a way that actors and directors and other collaborators can perform them. The performance in turn offers an audience a chance to participate in the make believe and be touched by something hidden to daily life but authentic and necessary to it.

 

Three streams of thought generally contributed to the writing of the play. 

 

Culturally we live more and more in a climate of unease.  Economic breakdown, fear of immanent shortages of resources, continual foreign wars, and from within our social divisions a creeping contempt for government and, by extension, the rule of law, all contribute to undermine our daily sense of well-being.

 

Moreover, a profound shift in the nature of childhood is underway, catalyzed by the communications revolution.  Our children have unprecedented access to the adult world, and the same technology that allows such access also confers the ability to circumvent adult restrictions.  We empower our children economically and materially, opening the way to adult privilege long before life experiences prepare them for it.  Rites of passage now consist of the gift of a cell phone, a credit card, and a drivers’ license.  Older and allegedly less civilized cultures never granted adult status to their young ones until they had first learned to sing and recite, that is, learned the sacred values of their community.  

 

The third stream pertains to a sense of the sacred, cultural and personal, contemporary and ancient.  It’s best to let the play speak for itself on that.
