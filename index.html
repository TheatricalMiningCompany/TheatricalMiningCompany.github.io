				Playwright's Bio:
				<span style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;color:yellow">
				  Joyce Walls is a Morgan State University graduate who developed her love of Theatre accidentally while working with and finally being trained in Stage Lighting and Set Design, by the late, great Clinton  CJ  Johnson.

The mother of 2 fine gentlemen, Joyce began writing more than 20 years ago after watching her eldest son's imagination come alive so vividly that she felt compelled to capture it in the form of a children's story. As a result, she has several children's stories currently being illustrated for publication.

Her love of writing grew as she tried her hand at writing novels and scripts for stage and screen.

Joyce is also the Founder and CEO of a Non-profit Organization she started to support Adults with Autism. Her youngest son has Autism.

Advised early in his development that she would have to be prepared to create what he needed to prevent him from falling between the cracks of society, she recognized a societal need and set into motion her contribution to a solution,  The Joy of Life Developmental Institute, Inc. .

Part of the proceeds from the sale of her The Soulman's Soul novel will be donated to the organization.

				Brief Synopsis:
				<span style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;color:yellow">
				  For fourteen days in July 2000, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met at the Camp David presidential retreat in an attempt to hammer out terms of a historic agreement to end the conflict between their peoples. In his new drama, Fourteen Days in July, Lewis Schrager draws from Ambassador Dennis Ross s recounting of those negotiations, documented in his classic memoir The Missing Peace, to create the first staged production of those dramatic, and ultimately failed, negotiations. Fourteen Days in July presents a unique glimpse into the strategy and psychology of the key players in the negotiation, including Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of Israel, Yasir Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, President Bill Clinton, and Ambassador Ross, U.S. Envoy to the Middle East and President Clinton s chief peace negotiator, as they struggled to overcome generations of hostilities, myths and grievances to reach a comprehensive peace settlement. The failure of these negotiations, as dramatized in Fourteen Days in July, provides a sobering reminder of how tragically close a peace agreement once had been, and a hopeful reminder that, with good will and trust on both sides, an end to this seemingly endless conflict is, in fact, achievable.

        TMC favors plays that make a strong statement about the human condition, and embraces controversial subjects. We believe the purpose
        of theatre is to inspire an audience to think and discuss the subject matter presented on stage. Of course, we like to have
        some laughter along the way.<br><br>
        We want to thank <a href="http://www.fpct.org/">Fells Point Corner Theater</a> for all the help and use of their space during development.
