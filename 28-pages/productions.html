		Synopsis</span><br>
		It's Thanksgiving and Mr. Von Shvonz is missing.  He came to the clinic for a nose job.  It proved to be fatal.  And now his
		body is nowhere to be found.  His wife is threatening lawyers and the police.  Chuck Binder, the head of the clinic, and
		Dr. Martha Grrthwkkk ask Mrs. Von Shvonz for one hour to find her husband.  Dr. Martha ends up finding him in the cafeteria
		walk in.  Dr. Wang, a cosmetic surgeon, had placed him there on his way to get a bit of cheese.   The only problem is there
		is an incision down Mr. Von Shvonz' chest that won't be easy to explain.  With the clock ticking, Dr. Martha tells Dr. Wang to
		get Von Shvonz back into the examining room while she heads off his wife.  Meanwhile Binder has locked Mrs. Von Shvonz into a
		room with schnitzel while he has a cigarette and a quickie in the ladies with the medical supply rep.  Mrs. Von Shvonz frees
		herself with a credit card and goes to Binder's office to confront him.  She is angry and violent.  Binder's secretary, Stella Dora,
		calms her down by knocking her unconscious.  Binder calls security on Stella.  Stella, feeling doubly betrayed, is suicidal and then
		upon reflection homicidal.  Meanwhile another botched job courtesy of Dr. Wang and a woman with Munchausen syndrome discover what
		has really been going on in the basement of this clinic.  Things come to a head in Binder's office with all the relevant parties
		and one epic turkey. <br><br>

		  Synopsis
		</span><br>
		The director has asked that the synopsis not be shown.
	  <!--
	  Arthur Easy Jr reluctantly returns home to discover his mother on the verge of selling their house and travelling the world in
	  search of enlightenment. Faced with no other option, he must ask for help from the father who has been incarcerated in a mental
	  health facility ever since the death of his daughter, Arthur Jr's sister, and who has spent eight years engrossed in argument
	  with an apparition of Jesus. Arthlur Jr's arrival is timely not only for his parents, but for Dr. Luvitz, his father's doctor,
	  whose stuffy ways and bookish character have left him helplessly pining for his assistant, Faith. Dr. Luvitz has come to view
	  the case of the incurable Arthur Sr. as the defining challenge of his career, and having nearly given up, encourages Arthur Sr
	  to interact with his son. Arthur Jr grows increasingly volatile and frustrated as he is first rebuffed by his father, then finally
	  meets with him in an encounter secretly orchestrated by Faith and Davis, the new art therapist on staff. The meeting goes badly,
	  and Arthur Jr is driven over the edge into madness as Act One closes. In Act Two, Arthur Jr brings to bear his inner ape, forcing
	  Luvitz to question what he knows or risk losing Faith, his mother to wonder what she is truly searching for, and his father to
	  finally confront the reasons for the persistence and existence of God.
