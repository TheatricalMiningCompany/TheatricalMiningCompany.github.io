    An actor and director, this is Andrew's first time working with Theatrical Mining Company and
	Baltimore Playwrights Festival.  Andrew received his dual degrees in Mass Communications and
	Theatre Arts from Towson University this past May. Recently, he performed in a production of

	also just finished teaching at Steve Yeager's Young Filmmaker's Workshop camp for young actors
	as an acting coach.  Outside of theatre, Andrew does graphic design work and enjoys trying to

	Mrs. Von Shvonz to her family and friends who have always been very supportive of her "theater"
	endeavors…most especially to her daughter, Erin.

	production of "Servant of the People". Later he was featured in the dual role of Belize/ Mr. Lies in "Angels in

	"Inspecting Carol" (Spotlighters), Frank Oppenheimer in "The Blue Eye of Robert Oppenheimer" (FPCT), Jake Latta
	in "Night of the Iguana (Spotlighters), and Toddy Koovitz in "Take Me Out" (FPCT). Most recently, Joseph appeared

	Joy had her introduction to the Baltimore theatre scene with January's
	"London Suite" at Spotlighters and was since seen in "Lumberyard" at Mobtown.  She has lived many places and finds
	a stage wherever she goes.  Favorite roles include the dark attorney in intense "Posers" as premiered at Theatre
	Charlotte, the less serious Old Gobbo in "Merchant of Venice" with Risley Theatre, and the just plain crazy Old
	Red in the independent film, Big Bad Wolf Project.  While in medical school in Vermont, she was awarded a Schweitzer
	Fellowship and started Prescription Laughter Theatre Company (performed comedies for the hospitalized and elderly,
	a spin-off of her involvement as an original member of Inspiration Theatre in Durham, NC).  Equally comfortable
	behind the stage as on it, she also dabbled with MFA tech work at UNC to supplement her many stints in production
	work.  In a case of life art imitating life, she also is a National Health Service Corps Scholar and works as a
	family physician for Jai Medical...and she promises her boss she has never made turducken on company time.

    A turducken is a dish consisting of a partially de-boned turkey stuffed with a de-boned duck, which itself is stuffed
