Stacey Bonds (Director) has been involved in Baltimore theater for years, both on stage and off. After directing two Baltimore Playwrights Festival readings this spring she jumped at the opportunity to direct one of this season's full-length productions. Past directing credits include Grease and The Fifth of July. Previous stage appearances includeGodspell (Gilmer), The Rocky Horror Show (Eddie/Dr. Scott), Psycho Beach Party (Chicklet), and Date with a Stranger (Paula). Stacey was a Regional Semi-Finalist in the Irene Ryan Acting competition for the American College Theatre Festival and took the title for "Actor of the Year" that same year. She would like to say a special thanks to her amazing Stage Manager for keeping her balanced and to Mark Scharf for writing this wonderful play.
