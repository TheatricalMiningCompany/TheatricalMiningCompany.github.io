				<br><br>
				<span style="font-style:italic">
				  With its mixed-race cast, this production interrogates not only the idealized American family but the American South. That
				  Big Daddy is played by an actor who is black, and that he is "the Delta's biggest cotton planter" in what is ostensibly the
				  era of Jim Crow, invests an added layer of significance to his rise from peon to patriarch and a sense of urgency to his
				  insistence on self-preservation.
				  <br>[...]<br>
				  Director Barry Feinstein and set designer Prince NO-RA make such effective use of the black-box space at Load of Fun Theater
				  that it seems like the only way the play should be staged.

				Gay Deceivers

				In the annals of history, along with the miraculous achievements of Edison, Whitney, Ford, and Einstein are innumerable
				lesser-known and long-forgotten accomplishments. <i>Gay Deceivers</i> is the story of one such woman and her ingenious
				contribution to modern life.<br><br>
				It is the autumn of 1909. In a golden era when new inventions lent a sparkle to drab, everyday life, Tallulah (Tolly)
				Roswell feels herself too plain to entice the attention of her progressively minded husband, Warren. In a desperate attempt
				to get Warren's attention, Tolly devises a plan to "supplement" her modest figure. When her first attempt proves a dismal
				failure, she continues, undaunted, to develop a practical system for bosom enhancement which she proudly describes as
				"Gay Deceivers". Rose, Tolly's best friend and sideline supporter of the Suffragist cause, is unable to resist getting
				caught up in Tolly's scheme, though she often expounds on behalf of the underlying principle. Nelson, Tolly's younger
				brother, supplies the fly for the ointment, as he and his best friend, Rudy, nearly ruin the whole lot in their desperation
				to earn money to attend the Hudson-Fulton Exhibition where there will be a real demonstration of flight. Reverend Godwin
				tries to keep a lid on the shenanigans-as the moral conscience of his community-and at least long enough to collect a hefty
				contribution from an aging widow in his congregation. <br><br>
				This quaint little comedy is chock-full of tricks and traps and the mischief which results from good intentions. Gay Deceivers
				is a 6 character, unit set play which explores the "history" of breast augmentation in a story where the deception is gay and
				gay deceivers abound.

				The Blessed Mothers of War

				The play focuses on two mothers -- one American, one Arab -- searching for their sons during a time of war. Zaira wanders the streets
				of the Middle East, asking if anyone has seen her son, Raja. Rosie, the owner of a small bookshop in Appalachia, waits for correspondence
				from her only son, Brian, who is stationed overseas guarding prisoners of war. When Brian receives an early discharge due to a mysterious
				injury, he returns home to a hero's welcome. However, Brian's internal struggle about what really happened in combat pushes him to the
				edge and away from his mother. As Rosie reaches out to her troubled son, Zaira finally finds Raja. The lives of these two women parallel
				one another and show the heart-breaking effects of war on all mothers -- no matter on which continent or side of the enemy line they reside.
				The structure of <i>The Blessed Mothers of War</i> mirrors Greek tragedy with a chorus of townspeople offering commentary on the action on stage
				and on war in general. The play shows how war can tear apart a world, a community and a mother and child.

				Almost Vermilion
			 </span>
			 <span style="color:cyan;font-style:italic">
				<br>by Sonja Kinzer<br>
				directed by Kathy McCrory<br>
				August 2 - 19, 2007
			 </span>
			 <br><br>
			 <span style="font-style:italic">
				Set in the 1950's in a rural WV farming community, Almost Vermilion is the story about the oppressive life of a creative young boy
				named Henry and his inventive mother Dorothy, who tirelessly attempts to balance out the tension & chaos ever- erupting by way of
				her overbearing husband, Clyde. Henry, who is about to turn 16, is an emerging art prodigy...a talent lovingly nurtured by his mother
				and desperately despised by his father who finds his art 'sissified' and downright useless, to say the least. Meanwhile, Paul Edwards
				the town doc and lifelong friend of Dorothy continues to encourage Henry with his artwork, all the while carrying a secret of his own.
				As Clyde's ill-mannered nephews settle in for a long, uncomfortable visit, both Henry and Dorothy struggle to come to terms with their
				very clouded futures. Called away to a family emergency, Dorothy begs Clyde to let her son come with her but is instead forced to leave
				him behind. When her worst nightmare is realized, Dorothy's struggle challenges her ability to trust in God, to trust in anything.
				Soon, it isn't possible to 'keep the peace' any longer, and she is forced to face the truth about her years of disappointment and the
				lifetime she spent wondering 'what could have been.' Isolation, oppression and ignorance are the opponents to the struggle for freedom,
				artistic expression, and evolution of self for both Henry and his mother. It is an account of a sometimes ugly journey that boldly spits
				in the face of all that is supposed to transpire within the protective walls of hearth and home.
