		  Synopsis
		</span><br>
      Jarvis Legend's Borrowed Skin is a dark comedy about an obsessed writer and the characters
		embodied in his play. With  only 37 pages completed, and two weeks to the deadline, Jarvis
		finds a representative from the granting council at his door demanding to see a near-completed
		script. Spending every waking hour writing Borrowed Skin, and every sleeping hour dreaming
		of it, Jarvis' obsession upsets his overbearing girlfriend, who commits him to an addiction
		rehabilitation center. There he is forced to remain an inpatient, without access to pen or paper
		until his addiction to writing is "cured". With mounting pressure from his characters, Jarvis
		must find a way to finish Borrowed Skin, or go mad.

		In 1909 when the public was mad for everything new and "modern", a housewife   invents the

		Synopsis
	 </span><br>
	 In the annals of history, along with the miraculous achievements of Edison, Whitney, Ford, and Einstein are innumerable
	 lesser-known and long-forgotten accomplishments. <i>Gay Deceivers</i> is the story of one such woman and her ingenious
	 contribution to modern life.<br><br>
    It is the autumn of 1909. In a golden era when new inventions lent a sparkle to drab, everyday life, Tallulah (Tolly)
	 Roswell feels herself too plain to entice the attention of her progressively minded husband, Warren. In a desperate attempt
	 to get Warren's attention, Tolly devises a plan to "supplement" her modest figure. When her first attempt proves a dismal
	 failure, she continues, undaunted, to develop a practical system for bosom enhancement which she proudly describes as
	 "Gay Deceivers". Rose, Tolly's best friend and sideline supporter of the Suffragist cause, is unable to resist getting
	 caught up in Tolly's scheme, though she often expounds on behalf of the underlying principle. Nelson, Tolly's younger
	 brother, supplies the fly for the ointment, as he and his best friend, Rudy, nearly ruin the whole lot in their desperation
	 to earn money to attend the Hudson-Fulton Exhibition where there will be a real demonstration of flight. Reverend Godwin
	 tries to keep a lid on the shenanigans-as the moral conscience of his community-and at least long enough to collect a hefty
	 contribution from an aging widow in his congregation. <br><br>
     This quaint little comedy is chock-full of tricks and traps and the mischief which results from good intentions. Gay Deceivers
	 is a 6 character, unit set play which explores the "history" of breast augmentation in a story where the deception is gay and
	 gay deceivers abound.
