            <u>Black Widows</u>, a new dark comedy, tells the sometimes comic story

            who devise a get-rich-quick scheme
            that spells trouble for a couple of homeless men in Los Angeles and
            ultimately leads to tragic consequences.

            that change their relationships forever.

					 <b>Playwright Ken Greller</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Amy Geller
				  </span>
				<br><br><br>
				At age 18, Ken Greller, Park School graduate, has had four plays produced, and NYU's Tish School of the Arts
				awaits his arrival this month.  Ken Greller's work is both captivating and exemplary of what captivates the
				young playwright's ear and mind.

				<td colspan="2">
				J. Wynn Rousuck of WYPR said of Greller's Comfort, produced by Run of the Mill Theater for Variations On Power,
				"The imbalance of power in a marriage (is examined) in a strikingly impressive debut work by Ken Greller.
				Young Mr. Greller writes about spousal relationships in a way that demonstrates a keen ear for naturalistic dialogue",
				and likened Greller's keen ear to Dramaturg, playwright, author, Yale and Swarthmore professor James Magruder,
				whose play, Pissing Match, was also in Variations.
				<br><br>
				Renowned playwright and former director of Run of the Mill Theater, Barbara Bryan, notes:  "Greller is the
				youngest playwright we have ever produced.  He already has a distinctive voice and a wonderful sense of theatricality
				in his writing.  Ken lives and breathes theater, and his personal theater library (extensive) matches mine in scope,
				which I found astounding for someone his age.  He has studied scores of playwrights on his own . . . We jokingly
				(and with admiration) call him 'the young Edward Albee'!  His maturity as a playwright is frankly amazing."
				<br><br>
				Theatrical Mining Compoany, in conjunction with the 25th Annual Baltimore Playwrights Festival, premiers This Is
				Why We Can't Have Nice Things.  Additionally, Ms. Bryan and Mr. Barry Feinstein, Director, Theatrical Mining company,
				dually note that many folks in the theater industry are "very fond of Ken".  Playwright Joe Dennison called Ken Greller
				"the next Mamet".  Mr. Greller just returned from The Kennedy Center Playwriting Intensive with Gary Garrison, Marsha
				Norman, and Theresa Rebeck.  He was also participant in NTI Theatermakers at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center, where
				fellow participant called Ken Greller "a national treasure", and Barbara Bryan alerted NTI Theatermakers that young
				playwright Ken Greller is "one in a million".  Ken will be a freshman at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in Dramatic
				Writing.  Ken's first day of college is the last day of his current production in Baltimore.
				<br><br>
				When you want things a certain way, you don't see things the way they are.  This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things is a
				heightened memory play; a humorous power struggle between two best friends and their respective lovers.  Their individual
				obsession with desire and control creats unintended consequences that change their relationships forever.  Is becoming an
				adult worth losing a friend?  This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things by Ken Greller; directed by Peter Davis.

            <br>Reviews
          </p>
          ...check out Ken Greller's "This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things." This young Baltimore playwright, who will be starting his
			 BFA in Dramatic Writing at New York University in the fall semester, has written one of the highlights of this summer's
			 Baltimore Playwrights Festival.

			 Mike Guiliano,

          <br><br>
          Ken Greller's This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things is an intriguing wisp of a play. Yes, it's yet another dysfunctional-relationship drama,
			 but it admirably transcends the limits of that currently overused genre. Brilliantly directed by Peter Davis, the production features an
			 ensemble of actors who convincingly bring this quirky meditation on romance and power to life.

			 GUILLAUME,
