				  Little Miss Mabelle would describe her maternal grandfather as a sweet, old man who makes her laugh and spoils
				  her rotten. So the Sick Stories her family members share about him must be figments of their imagination, right?
				  Wrong. In Sick Stories, Gentle Granddaddy, the drunken past conflicts with the docile present of a husband,
				  father--and Gentle Granddaddy.

				Brief Synopsis:
				<span style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;color:yellow">Lori comes to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to connect with the father she never met and to be alone in the presence of others. She meets Andrew, a college student doing research for a paper. When he tries to strike up a conversation, Lori appears to be uninterested in being friends with him. But Andrew persists and Lori finds herself looking forward to spending time with him.
<p>
As their friendship develops, Andrew discovers Lori's secret, and he's troubled by what he learns. He's not sure he can bear losing Lori, whom he cares about, so soon after meeting her. Andrew decides to share his own battle with depression in order to save Lori from her inner demons.
<p>
Interwoven with the stories of others who visit the wall, Lori and Andrew's story is about finding their individual paths to healing.</p>

				  Tricia Schwaab is delighted to have her first full-length play produced as part of the Baltimore Playwrights Festival. When she is not writing, she fancies herself a freelance editor.

        Theatrical Mining Company was founded by Barry Feinstein (Artistic Director), Roger Marshall, and Terry Kenney
        (Playwright Relations) in late summer of 2006 to develop <a href="http://baltplayfest.org/">
        Baltimore Playwrights Festival</a> entries that were not selected for production, and new play ideas.

        TMC favors plays that make a strong statement about the human condition, and embraces controversial subjects. We believe the purpose
        of theatre is to inspire an audience to think and discuss the subject matter presented on stage. Of course, we like to have
        some laughter along the way.<br><br>
        We want to thank <a href="http://www.fpct.org/">Fells Point Corner Theater</a> for all the help and use of their space during development.
